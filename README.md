### Ideas for new products, apps, softwares, API's

Every great app/website/product was once an idea. Google was once an idea. iPhone was once a concept. Every small idea can turn into a big thing, There are many people with ideas but dont have enough capability in terms of technology or money or time. Lets share ideas and validate them and find people with common interests to work on them. This could be a hardware product or app or website or some crazy thoughts. Let us share our ideas to make a world better place.

There would be four levels before someone get started working on it

1. Level 1 : Validate proposal, find duplicate (or) similar products
2. Level 2 : feasibility, do-ability of the idea, is idea still useful for future, rough timeline
3. Level 3 : make document with Requirements, underlying technology, other services
4. Level 4 : Compelete product idea with timelines, github pages, contributors

from there idea will become a real time product and tracked in its own page
